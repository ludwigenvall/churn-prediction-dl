# Churn Prediction with Deep Learning

This project simulates customer behavior using a Bayesian generative model and predicts churn using a sequential deep learning model (LSTM).

## Project structure

- `scripts/`: Python scripts for the generative model and training LSTM model.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for testing and exploration.
- `results/`: Figures and evaluation results.

## Installation

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
